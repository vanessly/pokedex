                <p>Hello! My name is CC Ly, and I am a third year studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan! I have been playing watching and playing Pokemon since I was 6 years old, so I wanted to showcase my personal favorites that Iâ€™ve gathered over the years. Each Pokemon on here has been on my final team at least once, so they all hold a special place in my heart. I hope you enjoy! </p>
